     "details":"All to often in the video game industry, innovative and original games and concepts wind up lost to time, sometimes halfway through, sometimes before the project enters production, and sadly, sometimes, just before the project is finished and ready for release. Putty Squad, a game that started development for the Amiga 500 in 1994, was one such game, with versions for the Mega Drive and PC DOS also slated for release in '95, before quietly wafting away into the annals of history after a few demo releases and some magazine coverage. However, in 2014, this updated remake of the game came out for the PS4 after some teasing a couple of years prior. Putting you in the role of an amorphous blue blob, Putty Squad gives you the task of rescuing other bits 'n blobs over the course of a variety of imaginative levels, aided by abilities gifted to you by your globular form, such as stretching sideways to go faster, stretching upwards to climb, and morphing into a fist to attack enemies.",

     "details":"A warm welcome back to the Bionic Commando series after a hiatus of two decades, a lifetime in gaming terms. Our hero Nathan \"Rad\" Spencer receives the wrong end of the stick as he is wrongfully sent to jail on cooked up criminal charges; worse yet he is also on death row. Doom destroys Ascension City on the day he is sent to the gallows with an earthquake-causing test weapon, rendering the city to ruins. Terrorists also take hold of the city's air defence network. What are they to do? Why, bring in the Bionic Commando of course! With his bionic arm he can cross lofty skyscrapers, latch onto far away objects, move using hanging girders and chart his own way through the city. \nWith optimal use of all dimensions, this game lets you move laterally as well as vertically, perform realistic action like hurling huge items, take the wind out of enemies, send foes flying into the air and tear the area apart. Brace yourself with apt weapons befitting a Bionic Commando. Nathan Spencer's voice is brought to life by Mike Patton of Faith No More fame.",
